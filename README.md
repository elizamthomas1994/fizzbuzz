# Fizzbuzz


## About this project
FizzBuzz is a simple single-function Ruby program that takes a number.
- If the number given is divisible by 3, the Fizzbuzz program will output 'Fizz'.
- If the number given is divisible by 5, the Fizzbuzz program will output 'Buzz'.
- If the number given is divisible by 3 AND 5, the Fizzbuzz program will output 'FizzBuzz'

## Learnings from this project
Through creating this app in a group environment, I improved my ability to:
- Write simple Ruby functions
- Test drive Ruby functions using RSpec Test driven development

## How to run
To run the fizzbuzz program, navigate to the lib folder and execute 'ruby fizzbuzz.rb' in the terminal.

To test the fizzbuzz program, navigate to the spec folder and enter 'rspec' into the terminal.
